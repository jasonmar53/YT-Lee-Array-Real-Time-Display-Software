ASCII Version of real time display 

File Usages
clear6/21 - clears all the simulated data read/generated to restart testing the real time display

phaseClosure_plot/6 - plots all the possible combinations of phase closures with the time span specified by the user

plot_x_baselines - plots the data real time using PANDAS to parse through ASCII files. Allows the user to alternate between plotting amplitude or phase and provides a GUI for the user to use phaseClosure and singlePlot. 

stim6/21 - simulates incoming real time data by reading full datasets and writing it out to a new file every second
